Explanatory Notes on the Invention Disclosure Form

You have invented something?

We encourage you to think about the legal protection and exploitation opportunities of your Invention as early as possible.
The longer you wait, the greater is the risk that others will get there ahead of you. Do not disclose your Invention to the
public. TUM ForTe Patents and Licenses provides information on any pertinent issues.

General Purpose of the Invention Disclosure Form

In the case of inventors whose relationship with TUM is that of an employee or a Beamter (civil servant) it must be
established, prior to the application for intellectual property rights, who is entitled to the exploitation rights in and
to the Invention. This is stipulated in the ArbEG' ). If the Invention

¢ is the result of your duties (commission, task) performed at the university, or
¢ is based substantially on the experience and knowledge and./ or the work of the university,

the Invention is deemed a service invention (§ 4) which may be claimed by the employer (§ 6). In this context it is
irrelevant where or when (on the weekend, for example) the Invention was made. If the university claims the Invention
without restriction, the university must apply for a patent without delay (§ 13). In such a case the inventor will be entitled to
adequate compensation (§ 9).

Every Invention which arises in the course of an employment relationship must be reported to the employer in writing
completely and without delay (§ 5 and § 18). The employer shall confirm receipt of the Invention Disclosure Form to the
employee promptly in writing (§ 5).

The Invention Disclosure Form is intended to enable the employer (as someone not skilled in the art) to assess whether or
not the Invention is a service invention and if yes, whether or not the employer wants to claim such Invention. Such
Invention can be claimed by the employer in written form (§ 6). If the employer is not releasing the Invention in written form
within 4 months after receipt of the Invention Disclosure Form (important deadline!), such service invention is deemed
to be claimed (§ 6 and § 8).

The documentation describing the Invention must be comprehensive enough to allow TUM, in its capacity as employer, to
decide if it wishes to claim the service invention and, as a consequence, wishes to apply for a patent therefor. To the extent
that the Invention and / or its development is.not sufficiently described and explained in the Invention Disclosure Form, the
employer may object to the Report within a deadline of two months (§ 5). If the employer.does not object to the Invention
before this deadline, the Invention is deemed properly disclosed. In the event of objections, the above-mentioned deadline
for the claiming of an invention will be extended accordingly.

Invention Disclosure Form
Objective and Purpose of the Form

In order to provide legal certainty, the law expressly prescribes that inventions must be disclosed in writing. However, many
inventors are not knowledgeable about how to report an invention properly. This Invention Disclosure Form (IDF) is
designed to solicit specifically the information that the inventor must provide. Thus any queries and / or objections on the
part of TUM ForTe Patents and Licenses may be reduced to a minimum from the outset.

An additional form provides a declaration of the inventor's supervisor in the relevant area (as a rule, the senior Professor)
unless this supervisor reports the.Invention himself / herself. The inventor is requested to present this form, together with
the IDF documentation, to his / her supervisor r before the Invention Disclosure Form is submitted to TUM ForTe Patents
and Licenses. This procedure is intended to avoid any misunderstandings between the parties involved.

* Arbeitnehmererfindergesetz (German Employees’ Invention Act); if not otherwise provided for, the Sections (§) quoted refer to the ArbEG.
;
Page 1 of 4

i
1

Ad 2. Enclosures

Essentially, the IDF should contain only information about the inventor, the development of the Invention, and the legal and
financial framework. The actual technical description and explanation of the Invention and any drawings shall be enclosed
and specified in Section 2.

Ad 3. Joint Inventors

If several persons have contributed to the Invention, it is sufficient to file a joint Invention Disclosure Form. This situation is
expressly accounted for in the IDF where in section 4.1 the percentage contributions to the Invention are to be indicated in
order to encourage the persons involved to come to an early agreement about the percentage of their contributions to the
Invention.

Those inventors who report their invention / inventive contribution(s) are requested to check the applicable boxes on the
chart at the top of page 2, and to sign the Invention Disclosure Form at the bottom of the last page. This does not apply to
co-inventors who, only for the sake of completeness, must be listed in the chart in Section 3 by those persons reporting the
Invention. A signature from so called external inventors is not mandatory.

At the end of section 8 the inventors filing the IDF confirm that, except for the persons indicated, no one else has
contributed to the Invention as inventor. This information is required for the designation of the inventor (§ 37 of PatG
[German Patent Law]) which must be submitted after having filed the patent application. Further, it is necessary for joint
future patent exploitation to know about any independent inventors and / or employees of other institutions who were
involved.

Those individuals must be designated as inventors who have made a substantial, inventive and original contribution to
the Invention.

Please note that your current home address is important for several reasons: on the one hand it is needed for
correspondence with you pursuant to the ArbEG (you receive the claim or the release of your share of the Invention to your
home address). Moreover, in case of a patent application the inventors have to be named to the patent office. Some
Offices (i.e. European Patent Office) send forms/confirmations to the inventors as well. In case of an exploitation of your
Invention (this can be years after your invention disclosure and potentially after termination of your employment) we
urgently need a way to reach you for your share of inventor remuneration. Therefore, in case of an address change please
give us early information about your new contact data at patent@tum.de. Incorrect or outdated addresses may result in
additional costs and a delay in your inventor remuneration respectively.

Employment Information (Sections 3.8 to 3.13)

This section requests information about the inventor's / inventors’ employment relationships at the time the invention was
made. Since at institutions of higher education inventions are frequently made when finishing a Bachelor’s, Master’s or
doctoral thesis, it must be indicated in 3.13 where the inventor(s) may be reached after completion of the thesis.

Information on the address in the Designation of Inventor (Section 3.14)

Regarding the Designation of Inventor, some Patent Offices demand that the complete address of the inventor is stated. It
is then disclosed in the course of the publication of the application. It is up to you whether your home address or your
office address is stated on the Designation of Inventor.

Please inform us if you want to forego completely on the publication of the Designation of Inventor, with some Patent
Offices a corresponding request can be filed.

Ad 4. Development of the Invention (Sections 4.2 to 4.4 and 4.7)

In Section 4 it must be specified whether the Invention evolved from an assigned task (“Aufgabenerfindung”), or from
experience / knowledge (“Erfahrungserfindung”) (Sections 4.2 to 4.4).

The question concerning research projects is intended to clarify any obligations of TUM towards the providers of third-
party funds. This question is asked again in the form “Declaration of the Chair or the supervisor respectively” because
experience has shown that as a rule detailed information can be provided only by the supervisor.

Should the Invention pertain to the field of activity of another institute or department of TUM, consideration must be given
to the possibility that the Invention could be used there.

Ad 4,7: If the Invention is based on a genetic resource which access is regulated by the country of origin, please send us
the ABS documents. Conditions for access for the respective country of origin can be found on the ABS Clearing House
Website www.absch.cbd.int

Ad 5.2 Description of the Invention

A comprehensive and complete description of the Invention must be enclosed. In accordance with the structure of a patent
application, the content should differentiate between the technical problem and the technical solution. The inventor is
requested to provide complete information on the prior art and enclose any literature references of which he / she has

Page 2 of 4

knowledge (see Section 2). This will facilitate any (patent) searches to be carried out. It will be helpful to enclose or to quote
the findings of the inventor's / inventors’ own research.

When describing the Invention, the inventors should focus on what is essentially new about their Invention. They should
indicate why it is their particular Invention that solves a technical problem, or what the advantages are that their Invention
has over prior art. Lengthy, unsuccessful pre-trials and the explanation of the scientific basic principles may be indicated
as auxiliary constituent of the Invention Disclosure Form. These do not represent the essential part of a.patent application,
but may contribute to the explanation of the Invention.

Please note: as inventor you are an “expert in the art” - please describe your Invention so that an “average person
skilled in the art” can understand it. Do not provide pages filled with mathematical equations, do not describe why
something works, but rather what one must do so that it works.

Ad. 7. Pre-publication of parts of the Invention

For the assessment of the patentability of an invention it is important to know whether or not parts of that Invention have
been made available to the public either orally or in writing (§ 3 of PatG). By signing at the bottom of this page, the
inventors agree to hold information about the Invention confidential until TUM releases the Invention or until the patent
application is filed.

Please inform us if you are planning a timely publication.

In order to avoid pre-publications that are prejudicial to novelty (shortly before trade fairs, conventions, etc.) inventors
occasionally file a (provisional) patent application. In order to ensure the proper course of the patent procedure, detailed
information on its status is important.

Please bear in mind that it is legally invalid to apply for a patent or utility model or to exploit the Invention if the
university was not involved prior to such application or exploitation.

Ad 8. Commercial exploitation of the Invention

Since patent applications are cost-intensive, the technical feasibility (see Section 6) and market opportunities for the
Invention (see Section 8) should be discussed at an early stage.

Inventors are permitted to, and in fact should look for potential users of their Invention during each stage of technical
development and through the entire process from the development of an invention until the granting of patent protection,
but only to the extent that neither the content nor the nature of the Invention are disclosed.

Ad 9, Information on data privacy:

The submission of your personal data serves the purpose of compliance with legal requirements, especially with the
Employee Inventions Act and the Patents Act. Therefore, your personal data are stored in electronic form and will be deleted
after a set period of time. Moreover, TUM may disclose your personal data to a third party in line with the patenting process
or the assessment process in case it becomes necessary for the implementation of said process. Depending under which
conditions your Invention was developed (e.g. a third-party funded project) and which course the Invention will take (filing of
a patent application; commercial exploitation), the disclosure of your personal data may become necessary with regard to
the following group of persons/institutions: Patent offices, patent attorney firms, patent exploitation companies (e.g.
Bayerische Patentallianz) industry partners (customer/co-owner), sponsors/project execution organizations, regional financial
authorities. Information on the processing of your personal data are documented in a description of the processing activity
in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Information related to the data protection of the submitted data
with regard to your invention disclosure, can be obtained from TUM ForTe P&L or the data protection officer of TUM.

Form ,,Declaration of the Chair or the supervisor respectively”

Inventors who made a service / job-related invention are requested to submit this form to their immediate supervisor or
other person authorized to issue directives together with the Invention Disclosure documentation.

Ad 1.: The inventor’s supervisor should be familiar with the details of third-party funded projects and their financing.

Ad 2: If the answer to that question is in the affirmative, the geographic origin of the genetic resource on which the
Invention is based has to be stated

Ad 3.: Particular material or financial resources which were expended for the Invention (for example, for the construction
of prototypes in the workshops) could give rise to financial claims against the inventor.

Ad 4.: The inventors supervisor should be familiar with intended projects.

Ad 5.: The supervisor confirms the information provided in the Invention Disclosure Form and that the supporting
documentation is correct.

Annex 1:

FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present Invention relates to the field of luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) based on materials containing fluorescent
proteins (FPs) immobilized in a rigid transparent polymeric matrix. ‘

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The power generation from solar energy using photovoltaics (PV) accounted for the 3.6 % of global electricity generation in
2021. However, traditional PV panels suffer of efficiency limitation, as well as are not optimal as building-integrated PV (BIPV),
due to sensitivity to incidence angle, shadowing, etc. Lately, much interest has been addressed to a forty-years-old
technology, i.e. luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs), consisting in a transparent polymeric wave guide hosting
luminescent species.

A new frontier in LSCs production has started in 2009 with the first implementation of bio-based components in LSCs, i.e.
phycobilisomes (Adv. Mater. 2009, 27, 3181). Besides couple of works implementing R-phycoerythrin (R-PE, Adv. Sustain.
Syst., 3, 2019 and chlorophyll (J. Mater. Chem. A, 6, 2018) new interest has started growing towards the use of fluorescent
proteins (FPs, Green Chem., 22, 2020). So far, they have been mainly implemented in liquid solar concentrators, that means
solutions embedded either in polymer (Appl. Mater. Interfaces, 11, 2019) or quartz cages (Green Chem., 22, 2020). Despite
no stability data are reported for such liquid LSCs, it is known that up-scaled liquid photovoltaic (PV) systems are related to
leakage issues and evaporation of the solvent. In addition, only a restricted number of B -barrel FPs has been explored so far
in LSCs, such as eGFP for green LSCs (Green.Chem., 22, 2020) and the red-emitting mScarlet by Sadeghi et al. (external
efficiencies over 2% in aqueous medium) among others (Appl. Mater. Interfaces, 11, 2019).

Overall, i) a suitable transparent solid-state FP-based systems for solar windows has not yet been proposed and ii) a well
structured investigation around different families of FPs in LSCs has not been provided, especially i in terms of stability over
time (Adv. Sci., 9, 2022).

The present Invention simultaneously solved these issues, providing:

i) aprotein stabilization method in a epoxy matrix resulting in the first protein-based solid LSCs;

ii) successful preparation of LSC-PV coupled systems with the highest opt and PCE values reported to date for protein
LSC-PV systems.

As follows, a short clarification for the above points is provided:

i) Protein stabilization in epoxy: several. polymer matrices have been developed in the last 10 years to stabilize
FPs against moisture, thermal and irradiation stress. Such materials have been mainly based on
polyethyleneoxide (PEO, Adv. Mater., 27, 2015, doi:10.1002/adma.201502349), polymethyl methacrylate
(PMMA, Nature Communications, 11, 2020, doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-14559-8), polyviniyl alcohol (PVA, Adv.
Funct. Mater., 33, 2023, doi: 10.1002/adfm.202300350) and hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC, Adv. Funct.
Mater. 2023, doi: 10.1002/adfm.202301820). In addition, they have been implemented in lighting applications.
Such materials share a strong hydophylic character and the possibility to be processed with a relatively high
amount of water:polymer ratio, with a percentage of residual water after drying process of min. 10 %. No study
is reported on the use of epoxies as stabilizers for fluorescent proteins in energy related applications — vide
infra, most probably due to the not intuitive possibility to use a polymer material whose preparation does not
stand a high percentage of water (<1%) due to the formation of colloidal dispersions of water in he polymer
during the curing process. Indeed, the use of epoxies with proteins has been mainly related to the samples
preparation (water-compatible resins) for microscopy techniques to investigate the effect of viruses/infections
on animal muscles. Here, we took inspiration from our expertize in the stabilization of proteins in hydrophobic
polymer matrices (polymethylmethacrylate, PMMA) thanks to the presence of a hydrophilic stabilizer
{trimethylpropaneethoxylate, TMPE), that has been already protected. We designed the protein-epoxy material
preparation method based on a specific ratio between two resin components, the polymer stabilizer, water
amount.

CLAIMS

In view of the above-mentioned, the following main claims are envisaged:

1. Method: The use of specific water:stabilizer:epoxy ratios and preparation procedure allows the direct implementation
of FPs in a thermosetting material, that has not been disclosed before in literature. Thus, the protocols to form protein-based
transparent epoxy polymer materials can be claimed as innovative and novel.

2. Material: The first use of fully transparent protein-based polymer materials suitable for the selected application exploiting
the implementation of FPs in epoxy resin.

3. Application: The first protein based solid luminescent solar concentrators featuring higher performances compared to
those prepared with liquid solutions of purified fluorescent proteins are presented with the potential to prolonge the shelf-life
of the device and solving typical issues related to solvent evaporation/leakage in building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs).

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

Protocol for protein-based LSCs preparation: FP-based polymeric LSCs were prepared implementing alternatively an aliquot
of PBS mGL (M), Tsapphire (T), DsRed (D) and smURFPs (S) solutions to a bi-component epoxy matrix bearing a small
amount of a polymer additive. This was gently stirred and poured into a mold. The optimal preparation protocol of the matrix
has been optimized in terms of maximum implementable PBS volume, epoxy:additive ratio, final drying conditions. M-, T-
and D-based materials were produced with 0.5 to 4 mg of protein, while S-based LSCs were prepared with an amount of
protein ranging between 0.5 mg and 2 mg. The upper limit has been dictated by experimental restrictions in the handability
of the protein at very high concentrations. The oligomeric character of S protein rules the ease of preparation of S-LSCs,
setting the highest amount of implementable protein at lower values compared to M.and D. All the proteins demonstrated to
stand the material preparation process, with no significant alteration of the excitation and emission spectra compared to
those in solution - Figure 1.

The samples were /) kept upon indoor dark conditions to estimate the self-stability of the coatings with the support of time
resolved fluorescence analysis and ii) subjected to simulated continuous daylight stress (1 sun constant irradiation) to
evaluate their photophysical properties under different stress conditions via time resolved fluorescence. The time resolved
fluorescence analysis revealed a long-term compatibility of the protein within the polymer matrix when the LSCs are kept
upon dark conditions in ambient, seen no significant deviations in the excitation and emission spectra profiles over time for
>1500 h (3 months) — Figure 1. On the opposite, M-based polymer LSCs suffer a slow and continuous quenching of the
emission features upon continuous daylight stress (1 sun), with a 50 % decrease in the 4 value already after 20 h, respectively.
For reference purposes, liquid LSCs, consisting in protein PBS-based solutions embedded in a quartz cage have been
Prepared and subjected to same conditions. This resulted in a lower stability of 3 h for M-based liquid LSCs upon 1 sun
irradiation. T-, D-, and S-LSCs show a more remarkable stability of the photophysical properties for 250 h/80 h, 500 h/300 h
and >300 h/100 h for solid/ liquid systems. Such losses over time are driven by a combination of H-transfer deactivation of
the protein and distortion of the chromophore upon irradiation stress. For istance, for S the deactivation mechanism results
prominent compared to the distortion in the solid state, since. no change in the PLQY value is recorded over time.

LSC coupled to photovoltaic system: M-, T- and D-based polymer LSCs bearing an amount of protein ranging from 0.5 mg
to 4 mg, as well as the S-based polymer LSCs bearing 0.5 mg to 2 mg of FP have been characterized once coupled to the
Si-cell upon simulated solar light (1 sun). Here, a system (R-PV) composed by the Si-cell coupled to a protein-free LSC (R)
produced with only the thermosetting material and the stabilizer has been considered as reference — see Figure 2 and Table
1.

M-, T-, and D- based LSCs results in a clear 20% to 40% increase in the optical efficiency (nop:) compared to the reference
system R upon increasing the amount of protein up to 4 mg — Figure 2/Table 1, with the 4 mg LSCs being the best performing
ones. In contrast, S-based LSCs lead to a 4 % improvement compared to R - Figure 2/Table 1. importantly, all the solid
LSCs allowed to achieve a minimum 1.7-fold enhancement compared to their liquid counterparts for M-based materials up
to a 2.2-fold improvement for D-based ones in terms of thopt. Overall, D-based solid LSC achieve the best pip: values, ranging
from 3.0 % to 3.8 %, while M-, T- and S-based systems reached 3.2 %, 2.7 % and 3.0 % topt at their best. Noteworthy,
our approach allows to reach PCE values of 0.32 % , 0.24 %, 0.29 % and 0.21 % for the best performing solid M-, T-, S-
and D- systems with only one photovoltaic cell, which is intuitively translated to PCE values ranging from 0.4 to 0.6%
considering to couple 2 PV panels to our concentrators. These values are perfectly in line with the state of art for green bio-
derived LSCs, where PCE values of 0.1 % and 0.27 % are reported for Chlorophyll/t-U(6000)) and R-PE/glass container (Adv.
Sustain. Syst., 3, 2019), respectively. Unfortunately, PCE values could'not:be recalled for phycobilisomes/acrylamide (Adv.

Page 5 of 4

Mater., 21, 2009) and mScarlet/PDMS systems (Appl. Mater. Interfaces, 11, 2019), hampering the comparison between red-
emitting LSCs (J. Appl. Phys., 131, 2022).

The stability of the optical efficiency values of such LSC-PV systems (0.5 mg of FP each) upon continuous daylight irradiation
have been performed. Considering L50 as the time to reach the 50 % of the initial relative gain in the nopt value compared to
a reference system R-PV (i.e., protein-free polymer coating for solid LSCs/PBS solution for liquid LSCs), M-, T-, D- and S-
LSC-PV systems showed L50 of 140 h/3 h, 110 h/6 h, 140 h/90 h and 220 h/2 h for solid/liquid systems, respectively.

Finally, protein-based FRET systems have been stabilized in the same epoxy matrix, aiming at pushing the system emission
towards the red region of the electromagnetic spectrum by absorbing in the UV. In detail, DT and ST systems were prepared
bearing 0.25 mg of either D or S, respectively, and T in a range 0.5-4 mg. The graphic overlap of the emission band of the
energy donor (T) and the absorption of the acceptors (D and S), is shown in Figure 3/Table 2. The corresponding DT- and
ST-PV systems achieve 1op: values in the ranges of 3.12-3.65 % and 3.19-3.3 %, respectively. This constitutes a 3 % and 13
% improvement compared to reference D- (nop: = 3.02 %) and S-PV (nop: = 2.81 %) systems bearing 0.25 mg of protein each
thanks to the energy transfer process.

Abstract: The power generation from solar energy using photovoltaics (PV) accounted for the
3.6 % of global electricity generation in 2021. However, traditional PV panels suffer of
efficiency limitation, as well as are not optimal as building-integrated PV (BIPV), due to
sensitivity to incidence angle, shadowing, etc. Lately, much interest has been addressed to a
forty-years-old technology, ie. luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs), consisting in a
transparent polymeric wave guide hosting luminescent species. Several types of fluorophores
have been used so far, both inorganic and organic, as well as bio-derived. Despite the recent
production of liquid LSCs exploiting Fluorescent Proteins (FPs) solutions embedded in
polymer/quartz reservoirs, a valid combination of FPs and suitable transparent solid polymer
matrix is still lacking in the field. Here, we first present single-protein based LSCs
implementing mGreeenLantern (mGL), DsRed and smURFP FPs in a versatile epoxy matrix,
showing ‘stabilities ~20 and >1500 days under simulated solar irradiation (1 sun) and dark
ambient conditions at their best. We also report the characterization of LSC-PV systems,
achieving record optical efficiency of maximum 3.7 % and photon conversion efficiency (PCE)
~0.64 %. In conclusion, our work constitutes a step forward in the optimization of FP-based
LSCs, introducing for the first time i) a novel matrix for protein stabilization in the solid state,
which has not been used so far in any photovoltaic or lighting application involving FPs, ii) the
use of green- and red-emitting solid bio-based LSCs and iii) the highest pop: and PCE values
reported to date for protein LSC-PV systems.

1. Introduction
According to the latest report of the International Energy Agency (IEA), power generation from
solar energy using photovoltaic (PV) solutions increased by 179 TWh in 2021, accounting for

the 3.6 % of global electricity generation, third after hydropower and wind.!'"| The impellent
need to replace fossil fuels and its progressively reducing cost make solar power one of the
most desired in the quest for alternative energy sources. Therefore, the introduction of zero-to
low-energy consumption buildings and the integration of solar-harvesting components into
urban infrastructures are playing a huge role in contemporary architecture.”! However,
traditional PV panels respond optimally to direct sunlight, being not optimal as integrated
architectural components, due to the numerous scattering and reflection phenomena which limit
their performance, as well as to their sensitivity to shadowing. In addition, several types of
photovoltaic cells reached a limit in efficiency, which corresponds to 26.1 % for
monocrystalline silicon solar cells (Si-cell). Therefore, much focus has been addressed in the
last decade to an already forty-years-old technology, i.e. luminescent solar concentrators
(LSCs). LSCs consist in a transparent polymeric wave guide hosting luminescent species able
to absorb sun-light and take part in the production of electricity when coupled to a photovoltaic
cell (Si, GaAs, DSSCs, eic.).2! Since LSCs are able to concentrate both direct and diffuse
sunlight, they have been proposed already at the end of the ‘70s as the solution to the efficiency
limitation of PV panels.!*7 In addition, LSC allow to use small area PV cells compared to the
active area facing the sun. This, together with the possible LSCs production from inexpensive

materials, is where this technology shows its full potential in reducing the solar light price.

As already addressed, there are different types of fluorescent species used in LSCs, both
inorganic and organic." On one hand, rare-earth ions!''-"3] and related metal complexes!!*!*1,

silicon QDs and heavy metal free CulnS2/ZnS core/shell QDs, respectively. Despite inorganic
luminophores show relevant features in terms of photoluminescence quantum yield (9),
thermostability, and overall efficiency in LSC-PV systems, they display several issues in terms
of fabrication and disposal, high cost, hazard for the environment, as well as for human
health.2728! On the other hand, several organic dyes?9*°! and polymers®!"! have been explored

A new frontier in LSCs production has started in 2009 with the first implementation of bio-
based components in LSCs, i.e. phycobilisomes.5! Besides couple of works implementing R-
phycoerythrin (R-PE)®°37! and chlorophyI1,"*! new interest has started growing towards the use

concentrators, that means solutions embedded either in polymer or quartz cages.9°! Despite
no stability data are reported for such liquid LSCs, it is known that up-scaled liquid photovoltaic
(PV) systems are related to leakage issues and evaporation of the solvent. In addition, only a
restricted number of B -barrel FPs has been explored so far in LSCs, such as eGFP for green
LSCs produced by Ferreira’s group (opt = 3.3 %, PCE = 0.35, liquid) and the red-emitting
mScarlet by Sadeghi er al. (external efficiencies around 2.4 % in aqueous medium) among
others.'°! Overall, we identify the lack of i) suitable transparent solid-state FP-based systems
for solar windows and ii) a well-structured investigation around different families of FPs in

LSCs, especially in terms of stability over time.!4!)

In this work we stabilize both green and red emitting FPs in a novel transparent matrix made of
a mixture of a thermosetting polymer and a stabilizer with a geometric factor (G) of 2.9. In
detail, we selected the highly emissive B-barrel mGreenLantern (mGL) "land DsRed, as well
as the red-emitting smURFP within the phycobiliproteins family.'3] The fluorescent materials
have been subjected to both atmosphere dark conditions and simulated solar light (1 sun),
preserving their photophysical properties (mGL: $ = 70 %, Aem = 510 nm; DsRed: = 22 %,
dem = 680 nm, smURFP: $ = 22 %, Aem = 680 nm) for >1500 h in dark and ~500 h upon
irradiation for the longest-living one, respectively. The protein-based LSCs have been coupled
to a monocrystalline Si-cell, achieving optical efficiencies (1) of 3.25 %, 3.77 % and 3.01 %
and photon conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.64 %, 0.6 % and 0.42 % for green- and red-
emitting LSCs, respectively, which are the highest reported to date for FP-based systems and
represent a 20 to 40 % enhancement of the device performances compared to reference protein-
free LSC-PV systems. Here, a systematical evaluation of the device lifetime in terms of optical
efficiency upon constant irradiation has been performed for the mGL, DsRed and smURFP
‘LSC-PV systems, achieving 140 h, 140 h and 220 h stabilities. In conclusion, our work
constitutes a step forward in the optimization of FP-based LSCs, reporting for the first time i)
a novel matrix for protein stabilization in the solid state, which has not been used so far in any

photovoltaic or lighting application involving FPs"4], ii) the use of novel green- and red-

emitting bio-based LSCs and iii) the highest top: and PCE values reported to date for protein

LSC-PV systems, providing an almost 2-fold enhancement of analogue liquid protein LSCs .
2. Results and discussion
2.1. A novel polymer matrix design for LSCs

First, we prepared several protein-based materials implementing PBS solutions of mGL (M),
DsRed (D) and smURFP (S) FPs to the first component of a commercial epoxy resin. After
addition of the second part of the resin, the mixtures were gently stirred and dried overnight in
a mold to obtain samples (M-1, D-1, S-1). Unfortunately, all the proteins undergo an immediate
precipitation in the form of colorless agglomerates already after the first step of preparation of
the material. Despite hard materials in the desired shape are obtained after the drying process,
the brightness of the protein results drastically compromised already by eye with respect to the

original solution.

Thus, we characterized the photophysical properties of M, D and S both in solution and in
polymer coatings — Table 1 and Figure $1. The photophysical properties of the three proteins

in solution resulted to be comparable with previously reported ones. M shows an emission
centered at Aem = 520 nm with a shoulder at Aem = 555 nm, which is associated to a main
excitation band centered at 500 nm and a less intense one in the range 200-300 nm. The
associated excited state lifetime (t) value results to be lower when the protein is embedded in
the solid state (M-1) compared to solution (2.03 ns vs. 3.62 ns, respectively) and
photoluminescence quantum yield () undergoes partial quenching up to ~60 % values
compared to 70 % in solution - Table 1. Similar considerations can be carried out for D and S
proteins, showing a red (Aem =585 nm) and deep red (Aem = 670 nm) emissions in solution,
associated to main excitation bands at 560 nm and 645 nm and @ of 80 % and ~20 %,
respectively. However, in the case of S, such properties are not preserved in the polymeric host

(S-1), where the quenched emission features up to 4 % of o values reveal even stronger

incompatibility with the matrix — Table

Here, we identified the urgent need of a suitable additive to stabilize the FPs in the matrix
formulation. In virtue of our previous knowledge, we selected trymethylpropane ethoxylate

(TMPE), which is known to provide a good hydrophilic environment surrounding the protein
4

and thus providing protection against pH and hydrophobic on not tolerated components of the

matrix.

First, we prepared several protein-free LSCs mixing the protein stabilizer to the polymer host,
to investigate the effect of the latter on the transparency and wave guiding properties of the
coatings. In a second stage, we also evaluated the effect of increasing amount of PBS solution
on the same features of the matrix. Therefore, 5 different matrices (A-0, B-0, C-0, D-0, E-0)
were produced upon increasing the amount of a stabilizing polymer agent from 0 mg to 0.348
mg without buffer solution —Table 1. Transmittance essays show that, in the absence of water,
no detrimental effect is ascribed to the stabilizer — Figure 1. The light-guiding properties of the
matrix have also been investigated upon increasing both polymer stabilizer and PBS amount.
The LSCs were irradiated on the main surface with Aem = 450 nm. Both the transmitted light
and the out coming light from the four edges were collected with an integrated sphere coupled

to a spectrometer — see Experimental Section. In Figure le, it is evident that an increase in the

stabilizer amount from A (0 mg) to E (0.348 mg

3) determines a decrease in the light-guiding
properties of the material. On the contrary, the wave guiding properties increase upon

implementing a higher PBS aliquot in the samples for a given amount of stabilizer (e.g., sample
5

A-0 vs A-50) — Figure le, However, there is a limit in the amount of PBS which could be

implemented in the matrix, which is experimentally set around 50 pL: a water amount

exceeding this value would determine opacity of the matrix and a milky texture — Figure 1b.
This is mainly ascribed to the role of water in the curing process of the resin. An excess of water
inside the samples could result in aqueous micro phases inside the resin, keeping the water
content in the epoxy phase. This could result in i) the acceleration of the curing process, but
also in ii) the remaining of uncured epoxy resin as colloidal with aqueous micro phase, with
consequent milky appearance of the materials.45]_ In the presence of 25 jtL of PBS, the light-
guiding properties look almost constant independently of the amount of additive/stabilizer —

¢, so matrix C-25 was chosen to produce protein-based LSCs, which would ensure the

possibility of i) implementation of high amounts of proteins which could require higher
volumes of buffer and ii) no alteration of the matrix wave guiding features in such cases. To
further confirm the role of the stabilizer on the samples prepared with 25 uL of PBS, several

additional data points have been considered — 1d. Taking into account the average of

the light wave-guided to the edges, the properties result comparable in a range between 0.087

g and 0.25 g— Table 1, confirming that matrix C-25 shows the optimal behavior.

2.2. FP-based polymer LSCs: preparation and characterization

FP-based polymeric LSCs were prepared implementing alternatively an aliquot of PBS mGL
(M), DsRed (D) and smURFP (S) solutions to matrix C-25 described in section 2.1. This was
gently stirred and poured into a mold. M- and D-based ones were produced with 0.25 to 4 mg
of protein, while S-based LSCs were prepared with an amount of protein ranging between 0.5
mg and 2 mg. The upper limit has been dictated by experimental restrictions in the handability
of the protein at very high concentrations. The oligomer character of S protein rules the ease of
preparation of S-LSCs, setting the highest amount of implementable protein at lower values

compared to M and D.

Figure 2. Top: Excitation and emission features of M (left), D (center) and S (right) both in
PBS solution (1 mg/mL) and embedded in the polymer matrix with stabilizer (0.5 mg of protein).
Bottom: sketch of LSC coupled to PV-cell and real pictures of LSCs hosting different FPs (left):

0.5 mg of S (blue), T (green) and D (red) upon simulated 1 sun irradiation.

When implemented in the polymer LSC, M shows an emission centered at Aem = 520 nm with

a shoulder at Aem = 555 nm, which is consistent with the emission profile of the protein in a

PBS solution — Figure 2, The corresponding excitation band is centered at Aex = 500 nm. As
notable, we do not report any excitation peak centered at 280 nm in the polymer matrix, usually
expected for the aromatic residues of FPs. This must be due to the intrinsic high absorbance of
the matrix at abs <300 nm — which does not allow a direct excitation of the
tryptophan residues, being the polymer:protein ratio strongly unbalanced towards the first.
These features are corroborated by a photoluminescence quantum yield @ ~70% both in solution

and solid state, despite a reduction in the excited state lifetime (t) from 3.6 ns to 2.3 ns — Table
B, which might indicate i) a distortion of the chromophore once embedded in the resin or an ii)
aggregation tendency of the protein once in contact with the polymeric host. Unfortunately, the
absence of the excitation peak around 280 nm hampers a deeper understanding of the energy
transfer processes occurring at the tryptophan/chromophore level, resulting in a lack of
information on the conformation and degree of compression of the chromophore. The emission
spectrum undergoes a gradual red shift up to ~20 nm upon increasing the protein amount in the
material. This goes hand in hand with a further decrease of the [400/497 ratio in the excitation

spectrum, as well as a red shift of the 400 nm peak up to ~15 nm. However, no reduction in

is noticed, as well as t stays constant ~ 2.35 ns up to the 3 mg sample. — F

D has been implemented in LSCs showing an emission centered at Aem = 585 nm, which is
consistent with the emission profile of the protein in a PBS solution — Figure 2. The
corresponding excitation band is centered at Acx - 500 nm. Similarly to M protein, the
chromophore faces a strong decrease of the t value from 3.9 ns to 2.7 ns when transposed from
liquid to solid state ~Table S1-2-3, which is associated to 65 % and ~80% 6 values, respectively.
The high in the polymer matrix is preserved even upon increasing the protein load inside the
polymer samples up to 4 mg, despite the drastic decrease in the average t value and a slight

broadening of the photoluminescence spectra suggest a high degree of packing already in the
presence of 1 mg of protein — Figure 3 and Table S1.

Finally, S-LSCs show main Aem = 675 nm, only 5 nm shifted compared to the emission in

solution (Aem = 670 nm) with 0.5 mg of protein— A ted shift of the emission peak

occurs upon increasing S amount inside the coating, up to 10 nm for the 2 mg coating — Figure
3 and Ti

excitation spectrum does not differ to the one of the protein solution in terms of peaks centered

. This occurs together with a slight broadening of the main emission peak. The

at Aem = 390 and 640 nm. In addition, the main excitation peak centered at Aem = 640 nm
undergoes a specular broadening of its shape and the more pronounced shoulder at 4. = 590 nm.
These changes in the fluorescence spectra are ascribed to different vibronic profile when the
protein is surrounded by a higher number of FP molecules, corroborated by a decrease in the

photoluminescence quantum yield from ~20% to ~10% and almost stable t values —

Moreover, the samples hosting high amount of S present aggregates of protein which are visible

by eye as multiple colorful dots inside the polymer.

2.3. FP-based polymer LSCs-PV system: device characterization and stability

M- and D-based polymer LSCs bearing an amount of protein ranging from 0.5 mg to 4 mg, as
well as the S-based polymer LSCs bearing from 0.5 to 2 mg of FP have been characterized once
coupled to the Si-cell upon simulated solar light (1 sun). Here, a system (R-PV) composed by
the Si-cell coupled with a protein-free LSC (R) produced with the thermosetting material and

coupling the solar cell to one side of a quartz cuvette containing the FP (0.5 mg) solutions, as

already known in literature — Table 2

M- and D- based LSCs results in a clear 20% to 40% increase in the optical efficiency compared

to the reference system R upon increasing the amount of protein up to 4 mg —]
2, with the 4 mg LSCs being the best performing ones. A higher amount of protein is not
implementable in the coatings due to the preparation limitations discussed in Section 2.2. In

Table 2. Here,

contrast, S-based LSCs lead to a 4 % improvement compared to R — Figure 3

the accentuated aggregation behavior of S, especially in the presence of high amount of FP as

already discussed in 2.2, results in predominant scattering and re-absorption events

leading to a loss of light which is effectively wave guided to the edges of the material.

Importantly, all the solid LSCs allowed to achieve a minimum 1.7-fold enhancement compared

to their liquid counterparts for M-based materials up to a 2.2-fold improvement for D-based
ones in terms of optical efficiencies.

Overall, D-based solid LSC achieve the best 1 values, ranging from 3.0 % to 3.8 %, while M-
and S-based systems reached 3.2 % and 3.0 % optical efficiencies at their best. Noteworthy, our
approach allows us to reach PCE values of 0.32 % , 0.29 % and 0.21 % for the best performing
M-, S- and D- systems with only one photovoltaic cell, which is intuitively translated to PCE
values ranging from 0.4 to 0.6% considering to couple 2 PV panels to our concentrator. These
values are perfectly in line with the state of art for green bio-derived LSCs, where PCE values
of 0.1 % and 0.27 % are reported for Chlorophyll/t-U(5000)!**! and R-PE/glass container, '37!
respectively. Unfortunately, PCE values could not be recalled for
phycobilisomes/acrylamide!*! and mScarlet/PDMS systems,'°! hampering the comparison

In order to evaluate applicability of these polymer-based materials as concentrators in the
context of solar windows, two main types of stability tests have been performed on M-, D- and
S- based LSCs (0.5 mg of FP each). The samples were i) kept upon indoor dark conditions to
estimate the self-stability of the coatings with the support of time resolved fluorescence analysis
and ii) subjected to simulated continuous daylight stress (1 sun) in concert with the evaluation
of both the photophysical properties and optical efficiency over time of the LSC-PV cell system
— see Experimental Section. In the latter case, liquid solar concentrators bearing 0.5 mg of M-,
D- and S-, have been built as previously discussed and considered as a matter of comparison.
Both for liquid and solid concentrators, we report the Lso value, i.e. the time to reach the half
of the initial relative gain in [op compared to the protein-free reference system, as an indication
of the lifetime of the LSC — Table 2. The time resolved fluorescence analysis revealed a long-
term compatibility of the three proteins within the polymer matrix when the LSCs are kept upon

dark conditions in ambient, seen no significant deviations in the excitation and emission spectra

profiles over time for the first 1500 h (3 months) — Figure S3.

In contraast, M-based LSCs suffer a slow and continuous quenching of the emission features
upon continuous simulated daylight stress (1 sun), with a 50 % decrease in the value already

after 20 h — Table S2. Such emission quenching, accompanied by a reduction of the average t
12

WILEY-VCH
value from 2.3 ns to ~1 ns and thus due to the evolution of the chromophore to its non-ionic
non emissive form, leads to the half of the initial relative gain value in optical efficiency of the
LSC-PV system after the first 140 h —

Such achievement results in a ~50-fold
enhancement of the performance of the liquid LSC-PV system upon continuous irradiation —
‘Table $3. Here, together with a faster photophysical degradation (50% of the $ value is lost
after 3h and gradual reduction of t value from 3.6 to 2 ns), we report a 50% of relative gain
loss after only 3 h.

Liquid D-concentrators coupled to PV systems result in devices with Lso of ~90 h in terms of
relative gain, despite it takes around 300 h to half the value upon continuous irradiation. Seen
a 150 h stable t value ~3.5 ns and 50 h stable value ~65 % - Table $3 we suggest i) an initial
photobleaching of a huge portion of proteins with no alteration of the chromophore structure
resulting in a drastic decrease of the Jsc and optical efficiency values, and ii) a consequent
distortion of the chromophore structure with further quenching of the emission properties and,
thus, of the device performances. A similar behavior is observed in the solid D-LSCs, where a

decrease in the t values is observed only after 250 h, accompanied by stable for 50 h,

achieving a 50% decrease in only after 500 h — Table $2. Therefore, the second-stage of the
degradation mechanism, dominated by a decrease in the both t and @ values results slowed

down once the protein is embedded in polymer matrix, achieving an overall device lifetime Lso
~150 h, intended as before.

In S-based LSCs no drastic change in the excitation and emission spectra occurs upon

irradiation over time both in solution and polymer, despite small variations in the I390/Ioas ratio

in the excitation profile — Figure $3. However, a critical decrease of 30% in values occurs
already after 3 h in solution, reaching the 50 % of the initial value after 100 h. This goes hand
in hand with a decrease in the t value from 1.9 to 1.5 ns, suggesting a photobleaching process
associated to chromophore distortion. On the contrary, S-LSCs do not face a decrease of the
photoluminescence quantum yield over time, suggesting a simple deactivation of part of the
emissive proteins in the materials. The reported increase in t values could be influenced by the
predominant excited state of the polymer matrix. S-LSC-PV systems undergo a gradual

decrease of the optical efficiency up to a 50% loss in the relative gain over the first 220 h for

In short, all the polymer LSCs demonstrated to be suitable for a reasonably long-term
application upon outdoors conditions. As proofed by the photophysical essays over time upon
dark storage conditions in ambient, with no significant change in the excitation and emission
spectra profiles for more >60 days, the performance upon solar irradiation would be further
prolonged in realistic day-night sun light cycles compared to continuous simulated solar

illumination.

3. Conclusion

The LSC concept was born as a solution to the limitation of the photovoltaic efficiency. Despite
it is a forty-years-old technology, it has been flowering and evolving in the last decade. So far,
several types of fluorophores have been used in LSCs, both inorganic and organic, as well as
more recent bio-derived components (phycobilisomes, R-PE, silk, chlorophyll, FPs). Here, the
valid combination of suitable FPs and a transparent polymer matrix to accompany the liquid
approach is still lacking. Moving to solid-state protein-based LSCs would prevent the typical
stability issues of up-scaled liquid photovoltaic systems, like leakage and evaporation of the
solvent. Our green and red-emitting fluorescent epoxy-based materials showed a relevant long-
term stability against both simulated solar light (1 sun) and a prominent self-stability in dark
conditions, preserving their photophysical properties (M: $ = 70 %, Acm = 510 nm; D: o = 80%,
Rem = 680 nm: S: 6 = ~20 %, dem = 680 nm) for >20/500/>300 h and >15¢ i

conditions, respectively. Such achievements drastically enhance those related to reference
liquid LSC here reported, which turned to be 3 h, 300 h and 100 h stable upon analogue
irradiation conditions. Single protein-based LSCs have been coupled to a monocrystalline Si-
cell, achieving optical efficiencies (ut) of 3.2 % and photon conversion efficiency (PCE) of
0.32 % for the green solid LSCs, while the red counterparts achieve op/PCE values of
3.8/0.21 % for DsRed and 3.0/0.29 % for smURFP: Overall, all the LSCs resulted successful
in overpassing the efficiency limit of the reference system built with a protein-free transparent
epoxy-based material, providing up to 40% enhancement in the generated Jsc, depending on the
type of LSCs and amount of protein. Importantly, all the solid LSCs allowed to achieve a
minimum 1.7-fold enhancement compared to their liquid counterparts for M-based materials
up to a 2.2-fold improvement for D-based ones. These results refer to a one-PV cell architecture,
and therefore a higher gain will be expected when coupling the LSC to at least 2 PV cells. To
conclude, with this work we set one step forward in the optimization of FP-based LSCs,
reporting for the first time i) liquid LSCs bearing novel B-barrel and phycobiliproteins,

complete of stability evaluation over time both in terms of photophysics and efficiency, ii) a
14

novel matrix for protein stabilization in the solid state, iii) the highest pop: and PCE reported to

date for FP-based LSCs.
4. Experimental Section

Protein production and purification: : Tsapphire and smURFP were expressed in Escherichia
coli BL21 and purified by \

pg column in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) buffer. Purified

proteins were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at —80 °C. Thawed proteins were
centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used for the

measurements.

Polymer matrix design and preparation: The LSCs were prepared implementing an aliquot of
a PBS solution to a stabilizer. The polymer was added on top and the resulting mixture was
gently stirred and poured into a mold. Several coatings were produced upon increasing the
amount of stabilizer and the trasmittance properties were studied with a Shimadzu UV-VIS
spectrophotometer Uv-2700i. The effect of the increasing amount of PBS solution on the
waveguiding properties was studied for samples prepared with three different amount of
stabilizer. The same properties were also investigated upon increasing amount of stabilizer on
samples prepared with the optimized amount of PBS solution. The LSC were irradiated on the
main surface with a WINGER® WEPRBI-S1 Power LED Star royal blue (450nm). Both the
transmitted light and the outcoming light from the four edges were collected with an AvaSphere
30-Irrad Integrated sphere coupled to an Avantes Spectrometer 2048L (300 VA grating, 200 um
slit, CCD detector). The light was collected on three adiacent spots per edge/surface (5 mm
measurement port for AvaSphere 30-Irrad Integrated sphere). The reported waveguiding
efficiency is calculated based on the average of the light collected in the 12 spots measured on

the 4 edges. The employed power source was a Keithley 2231-A-30-3.

FP-based LSC preparation and characterization: The LSCs were prepared implementing an
aliquot of a PBS protein solution to a stabilizer. The constituting polymer was added on top and
the resulting mixture was gently stirred and poured into a mold. The photophysical
characterization (excitation and emission spectra, , t) was carried out with a FSS

Spectrofluorometer from Edinburgh Instruments, using SC-5 module for liquid samples, SC-

15

10 module for solid samples, and SC-30 Integrating Sphere to determine ¢. All measurements

were performed at RT in ambient.

LSC self-stability tests: The LSCs were either irradiated using WINGER® WEPW3-S1 Power
LED Star white (6500K) as pumping source or stored in dark conditions. The employed power
source was a Keithley 2231-A-30-3. The photophysical characterization (excitation and
emission spectra, $, t) was carried out over time with a FS5 Spectrofluorometer from Edinburgh

Instruments using SC-10 module.

LSC-Solar cell systems characterization: LSCs were coupled with one monocrystalline solar
cell IXOLAR™ SolarBITs (KXOB2-02X8F). J-V curves have been recorded placing the solar
cell in contact with each one of the edges of the LSC The J—V characteristics were recorded
using linear sweep voltammetry with PGSTAT30 potentiostat (Ecochemie). The LSC was
irradiated either with simulated light solar simulated light (1 sun, 1000 W m” ) calibrated with
a KG5-filtered Silicon reference cell (Newport/Oriel, Model 91150V) using solar simulator
Sol3A 94023A (Class AAA, 450 W Xenon Lamp, AM 1.5G) from Newport or with 0.2 sun
illumination simulated with a WINGER® WEPCW3-S1 Power LED Star cold white (14000K).
In the latter case, the employed power source was a Keithley 2231-A-30-3. The IPCE scans of
LSCs coupled to the solar cell were recorded from 300 to 1100 nm.

The figures of merit reported in Table 2 were calculated to as follows!4°47!:

Design and Optimization of Solar-Light Harvesting using Fluorescent Proteins

Embedded in a Waveguiding Polymer Matrix for Luminescent Solar Concentrators

The recent production of liquid LSCs based on Fluorescent protein (FPs) solutions embedded
in polymer/quartz reservoirs goes hand in hand with the lack of suitable transparent polymer
matrices to stabilize FPs in Luminescent Solar Concentrators (LSCs). Here, we develop a
waveguiding matrix to host FPs, specifically the green Tsapphire and the red smURFP,
achieving both single- and two-protein LSC-PV systems with optical efficiency of 3.4 % and
photon conversion efficiency (PCE) ~1.3%, at their best.

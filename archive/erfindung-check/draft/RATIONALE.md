# RATIONALE

## What I Changed and Why

1. **Simplified Language and Structure**: I simplified the language and structure to better fit the "unsichere Erfinder:in mit konkreter Idee" persona, who lacks patent expertise and has limited time. The instructions are now more direct and actionable.

2. **Combined and Reordered Steps**: Steps that shared similar logic were combined to reduce complexity. For example, "Patente prüfen" and "Publikationen prüfen" were combined into one step focusing on "Prior Art suchen". This addresses the issue of complexity and redundancy.

3. **Added Explicit Risk Warnings**: An explicit limitation and risk warning was added in the introduction to address the inadequate risk warnings identified in the quality feedback.

4. **Clearer Input-Output Handoffs**: Each step now clearly states what is needed from the previous step and what the output will be, addressing the issue of unclear transitions between steps.

5. **Concrete Tips and Examples**: The "Tipp" sections now include concrete examples and decision rules, addressing the issue of vague tips.

## Step Mapping (Old Steps → New Steps)

- **Step 0: Einleitung** remains unchanged but includes a risk warning.
- **Step 1: Kategorie wählen** remains unchanged.
- **Step 2: Markt scannen** remains unchanged.
- **Step 3 & 4: Patente prüfen + Publikationen prüfen** → Combined into "Prior Art suchen".
- **Step 5: Treffer bewerten** remains unchanged.
- **Step 6: Kern schärfen** remains unchanged.
- **Step 7: Ergebnis ableiten** remains unchanged.

## How Each Change Addresses a Quality-Grade Issue

1. **Assumption of Prior Knowledge**: Simplified language and added guidance reduce the need for prior knowledge.
2. **Complexity and Overwhelm**: Combined steps reduce the number of actions required, making the process less overwhelming.
3. **Lack of Clear Guidance**: Clearer instructions and examples in the "Tipp" sections provide actionable steps.
4. **Inadequate Risk Warnings**: The introduction now includes a risk warning, making users aware of the limitations.
5. **Inconsistent Structure**: Clear input-output handoffs ensure a logical flow and reduce confusion.

# Erfindung-Check Process Guide

## PROCESS OVERVIEW

- **Purpose and Goal**: The Erfindung-Check process is designed to help users evaluate the novelty of their invention ideas by systematically searching for similar existing solutions, patents, and publications. The goal is to determine whether an idea is "new," "unclear," or "already known," and to guide the user on the next steps.

- **Target User**: Individuals or teams with invention ideas looking to assess the novelty and potential patentability of their concepts.

- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Erfindung (Invention)**: A new, concrete solution to a specific problem that can be described in a way that others could replicate or implement it.
  - **Kernprinzip (Core Principle)**: The fundamental mechanism or idea behind the invention.
  - **Prior Art**: Existing products, patents, or publications that may be similar to the invention.

- **Decision Points**: Categorization of findings.
- **Suggested Tools/Sources**: Manufacturer websites, YouTube, forums, articles.

### Step 3: Check Patents
- **Purpose**: Determine if the core principle is already patented.
- **Inputs Required**: Keyword set from Step 2.
- **Actions to Perform**:
  1. Use patent databases like Espacenet and Google Patents.
  2. Search with 2-4 keyword combinations in both languages.
  3. Filter results through images, abstracts, and claims.
- **Outputs to Produce**: List of relevant patents with relevance notes.
- **Decision Points**: Relevance of patent findings.
- **Suggested Tools/Sources**: Espacenet, Google Patents.

### Step 4: Check Publications
- **Purpose**: Identify similar approaches in publications.
- **Inputs Required**: Keyword set from Step 2.
- **Actions to Perform**:
  1. Search databases like Google Scholar and PubMed.
  2. Use keyword combinations and refine with patent-derived terms.
  3. Filter through titles, abstracts, and diagrams.
- **Outputs to Produce**: List of relevant publications with relevance notes.
- **Decision Points**: Relevance of publication findings.
- **Suggested Tools/Sources**: Google Scholar, PubMed, Lens.org.

### Step 5: Evaluate Findings
- **Purpose**: Assess the similarity of findings to the core principle.
- **Inputs Required**: Findings from Steps 2, 3, and 4.
- **Actions to Perform**:
  1. Compile findings and categorize them by similarity.
  2. Document the similarities and differences.
- **Outputs to Produce**: Evaluation table of findings.
- **Decision Points**: Categorization of findings.
- **Suggested Tools/Sources**: None.

### Step 6: Sharpen Core Idea
- **Purpose**: Formulate the core idea of the invention.
- **Inputs Required**: Evaluation from Step 5.
- **Actions to Perform**:
  1. Focus on significant differences.
  2. Formulate the core idea in one sentence.
  3. Develop 2-3 variants.
  4. Derive a small keyword set for final checks.
- **Outputs to Produce**: Core idea statement, variants, and keyword set.
- **Decision Points**: Formulation of core idea.
- **Suggested Tools/Sources**: None.

### Step 7: Derive Result
- **Purpose**: Conclude the novelty assessment.
- **Inputs Required**: Core idea from Step 6.
- **Actions to Perform**:
  1. Use previous findings to decide on the novelty status.
  2. Determine the next action based on the status.
- **Outputs to Produce**: Final status and next action plan.
- **Decision Points**: Determination of novelty status.
- **Suggested Tools/Sources**: None.

## EVALUATION FRAMEWORK

- **Classifying Hits**:
  - **Same Function/Different Mechanism**: Appears similar but distinct.
  - **Similar Mechanism/Different Purpose**: Potentially relevant.
  - **Same Function and Mechanism**: Highly similar, critical to assess.

- **Deriving Final Status**:
  - **New Seems Plausible**: No close matches.
  - **Unclear**: Close matches exist but can be distinguished.
  - **Rather Known**: Matches are very similar.

- **Next Actions**:
  - **New**: Document thoroughly and maintain confidentiality.
  - **Unclear**: Refine core idea and conduct further searches.
  - **Known**: Consider pivoting or exploring new combinations.

## KEYWORD & SEARCH STRATEGY

- **Building Keyword Sets**:
  - Identify key terms related to the mechanism, effect, and context.
  - Use synonyms and variations to broaden the search.

- **Search Term Structure**:
  - Combine function, object, and context (e.g., "quick release" + "latch" + "one hand").

- **Sources per Category**:
  - **Mechanics**: Product pages, patents.
  - **Process/Chemistry**: Academic papers, patents.
  - **Software**: GitHub, technical blogs.
  - **Medicine**: Medical journals, clinical trial databases.

## KERNIDEE (CORE IDEA) TEMPLATE

- **Sentence Structure Pattern**:
  - "New is that [mechanism/structure] is executed such that [effect/advantage] under [condition/context] arises."

- **Deriving Variants**:
  - Consider different arrangements, materials, or triggers while maintaining the core idea.

- **Quality Criteria**:
  - Avoid vague terms like "better," "more efficient"; focus on specific mechanical differences.

2. **Added Steps**: Introduced a step focusing on understanding the publication trap and its implications more deeply. This directly addresses the critical feedback regarding the lack of clarity on this topic.
3. **Split Steps**: The step on choosing a protection strategy was split to offer a clearer distinction between understanding options and making a decision. This improves clarity and helps the user make informed choices.
4. **Reordered Steps**: The flow was adjusted to ensure that the user first understands the risks and limitations before proceeding to make strategic decisions. This addresses the feedback on the lack of emphasis on professional legal advice.
5. **Added Elements**: More detailed tips and examples were included to make the guide more actionable and less vague. This directly addresses the feedback on the clarity and actionability of the guide.

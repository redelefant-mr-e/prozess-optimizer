## CONTEXT-SPECIFIC LOGIC

- **University/Research Institute**:
  - **Meldepflicht**: Yes, typically required.
  - **TTO**: First point of contact.
  - **Typical Flow**: Report to TTO → Strategy discussion → Possible patent filing.

- **Company with R&D**:
  - **Patentstelle**: First point of contact.
  - **Vorgesetzte**: May also be involved.
  - **Typical Flow**: Report to Patent Office → Strategy discussion → Possible patent filing.

- **Startup/Solo**:
  - **No Meldepflicht**: Directly manage the process.
  - **Patent Attorney**: Consult early for strategic advice.
  - **Typical Flow**: Consult advisors → Strategy decision → Possible patent filing.

## PUBLICATION TRAP

- **What It Means**: Public disclosure of an invention can prevent patenting.
- **When to Warn the User**: Before any public disclosure (e.g., papers, presentations).
- **Checklist Before Any Publication**:
  - [ ] Confirm invention is reported (if required).
  - [ ] Determine if a patent is planned.
  - [ ] File patent application before public disclosure.

## NEXT ACTION FRAMEWORK

- **Derive Next Action**: Use context, contacts, and strategy to determine the next step.
- **When to Recommend Involving a Patent Attorney**:
  - Before filing a patent.
  - In case of conflicts or uncertainties.
  - For strategic guidance.
